# ProkEukModel
I am designing a machine learning model that can predict if a DNA read is Prokaryotic or Eukaryotic based on AT and 3-mer content of the DNA. This code is used for conducting 10 fold cross validation and feature selection on the training data set which includes the AT and 3-mer content (the features) of 750,000 reads of DNA (half of the reads prokaryotic, other half eukaryotic).
